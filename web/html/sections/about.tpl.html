            I'm a software engineer, architect, and technology strategist with 15+ years of hands-on experience in
            building scalable digital systems – with a strong focus on insurance and fintech.

            My work bridges deep technical expertise in areas like Python, cloud infrastructure, and automation with a
            broader vision for sustainable digital transformation. I’ve designed distributed architectures, led agile
            engineering teams, and delivered AI-driven solutions that help organizations become more efficient, secure,
            and future-ready.

            What drives me is not just writing clean code or designing robust systems – but enabling people, shaping
            technology strategy, and building digital ecosystems that last.

            “Great tech doesn't just solve problems. It empowers people, creates clarity, and helps companies grow
            with confidence.”

            I'm always curious about how technology, leadership, and purpose intersect – and how we can build better
            systems by thinking beyond code.
